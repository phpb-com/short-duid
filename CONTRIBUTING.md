Follow the style you observe in the code and you should be fine. I do not have any particular preferences toward any style, as long as the project is small.

The following contributions are the most welcome:
- If you are using this module, I would like to know about it, please ...
- C++ code improvements, it is a little over-engineered now
- Improvements to the tests
- Examples, examples, exampes ... (need I say more?)
